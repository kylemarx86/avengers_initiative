| Synopsis1           = The Swordsman infiltrates the Avenger's base and Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver attack him. He then admits he was testing them and wants to apply for membership. Captain America intervenes, saying the Swordsman is a wanted man. He escapes, however. Hawkeye explains that the Swordsman used to be his tutor when he was in the circus.

Meanwhile, in Nick Fury's office in Washington D.C., HYDRA agents find a letter from Captain America, explaining how Captain America wanted to work for S.H.I.E.L.D. They discard it as trash. A mobster finds it and gives it to the Swordsman.

A trap is laid for Captain America. He leaves the Mansion, thinking he is going to meet with Nick Fury. Hawkeye finds out about the plan and gathers the other Avengers to help him.

Captain America battles the Swordsman and gets captured before the others can arrive to help. The Swordsman then holds him captive on a scaffolding, threatening to hurl Cap to his death if the other Avengers interfere. But Captain America jumps off the scaffolding so the Avengers don't have to surrender.
